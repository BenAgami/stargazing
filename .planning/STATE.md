# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Users can record themselves doing calisthenics exercises and get actionable AI feedback on their form — what they did well and what to fix.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — manual-workout-builder

## Current Position

Phase: 3
Plan: Not started

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: - min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Custom Expo dev build (react-native-vision-camera + react-native-fast-tflite) is a hard gate — validate on both simulators before writing any ML code. If it fails, real-time path must fall back to server-side inference.
- Phase 1: processingStatus state machine must implement full PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED / FAILED with a 10-minute server-side timeout cleanup job. It currently never advances beyond PENDING.
- Phase 5 before Phase 6: Post-set analysis validates the angle-detection approach and locks the feedback format that the real-time rule engine keys off.
- Phase 2 before Phase 4: AI workout generation prompt requires fitness level and goal from user profile for calibration.
- [Phase 02-user-profile]: Catch P2002 without meta.target check — Prisma 7 with pg driver adapter omits target field; code check alone is sufficient
- [Phase 02-user-profile]: Mock getSignedUrl in avatar upload tests — appropriate exception to no-mock rule for external AWS SDK I/O
- [Phase 02-user-profile]: useFocusEffect not useEffect on profile screen: Expo Router stack does not remount on back-navigation; useEffect with [] shows stale data after returning from profile-edit
- [Phase 02-user-profile]: Goal change detection snapshots initial goal on load, compares all fields before POST /me/goals to prevent duplicate UserGoal records on unchanged Save
- [Phase 02-user-profile]: AuthContext created as Rule 3 fix: native app had no JWT persistence; stores token in AsyncStorage under @cali_auth_token
- [Phase 02-user-profile]: One scheduleNotificationAsync call per selected weekday — WeeklyTriggerInput only accepts one weekday, so scheduling N days requires N calls
- [Phase 02-user-profile]: AsyncStorage stores both notification IDs (for cancellation) and config (for display) under separate keys workoutReminderIds and workoutReminderConfig

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- INFRA-05: EAS Build or local Xcode/Android Studio availability must be confirmed before Phase 1 starts. If neither is available, Phase 6 (real-time) must be redesigned around server-side inference only.
- Redis instance: BullMQ requires Redis. Confirm infrastructure (Upstash or managed Redis) before Phase 1 kicks off.
- Codebase fix backlog (from CONCERNS.md): error handler `any` type, BigInt global serializer, CORS wildcard — all must be addressed during Phase 1 before AI errors are introduced.
