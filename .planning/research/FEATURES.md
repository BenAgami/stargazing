## Feature Landscape

### Table Stakes (Users Expect These)

Features users assume exist. Missing these = product feels incomplete or untrustworthy.

| Feature                                    | Why Expected                                                                                                                           | Complexity | Notes                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exercise library with video demos          | Every fitness app has this; users need to know what correct form looks like before filming themselves                                  | LOW        | Already seeded via API. Native UI just needs to display it.                                                          |
| Workout session logging (sets, reps, rest) | Core fitness tracking primitive; without it there's nothing to analyze over time                                                       | LOW        | Session model already exists. Needs UI wiring.                                                                       |
| Post-set video upload + AI form feedback   | This is the core product promise. Users who download specifically for AI analysis will churn immediately if absent                     | HIGH       | The primary new technical surface. Requires video ingestion, pose estimation, and LLM feedback generation.           |
| Form score per set                         | Users need a concrete output to anchor progress ("I went from 62 to 79 on push-ups"). Pure text feedback without a number feels vague  | MEDIUM     | Scoring schema must be consistent enough to trend over time. Define rubric before building.                          |
| Progress over time — form score history    | Users need to see their arc. Without trend data the AI feedback is a one-off event, not a coaching relationship                        | MEDIUM     | Requires persisting scores per set with timestamps. Simple charting on mobile.                                       |
| User profile (name, avatar, fitness level) | Required for personalization framing. "Your AI coach" feels hollow without it. Also used to calibrate difficulty of generated workouts | LOW        | Display name, avatar, fitness level (beginner/intermediate/advanced), goals. Do not bloat with biometric data in v1. |
| Workout builder — manual                   | Users who are experienced athletes or have specific programs will not trust AI-only generation. Manual fallback is required            | MEDIUM     | Pick exercises from catalog, set reps/sets/rest, name and save.                                                      |
| Named, saveable workouts                   | Repeat-ability is the core habit loop. Users need to run "my Monday push workout" without rebuilding it                                | LOW        | Depends on manual workout builder. Simple save/load.                                                                 |
| Push notifications for workout reminders   | Standard retention mechanic. Apps without this see rapid DAU decay                                                                     | LOW        | Basic scheduled local notifications via Expo. Do not build a complex rule engine in v1.                              |

### Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)

Features that set the product apart. These align with the core value: "film yourself, get coached."

| Feature                                      | Value Proposition                                                                                                                                                                                         | Complexity | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Real-time form cues during a set             | Competitors (Gymscore, ChAIron) offer post-hoc analysis. Live audio/visual cues mid-set change the training experience — you correct immediately rather than after the fact                               | HIGH       | Requires on-device pose estimation (MediaPipe via TFLite) running at inference time. Battery and latency constraints are real. This is the hardest feature in the roadmap. Validate post-set analysis first. |
| AI-generated workout from a goal description | "Build a 4-day upper-body program for someone who can do 10 pull-ups" — natural language to structured workout. Freeletics does this but within rigid templates. LLM generation is more flexible          | MEDIUM     | Claude API with a structured output schema. Requires user profile context for calibration. Validate the manual builder first so AI output can be compared to a known good baseline.                          |
| Per-exercise form score trend charts         | Most apps show session-level volume/weight trends. Showing "your push-up quality score over 8 weeks" is unique to AI-analysis apps and directly reinforces the core value                                 | MEDIUM     | Requires aggregating set-level AI scores. Needs at least 3-4 sessions of data before charts are meaningful — use empty states well.                                                                          |
| Actionable, rep-level feedback text          | Generic feedback ("keep your back straight") is table stakes in 2026. Specific, rep-referenced feedback ("in rep 4, your hips dropped 20 degrees") is differentiated and builds trust in the AI           | MEDIUM     | LLM prompt engineering + structured output from pose data. Quality depends heavily on the quality of pose keypoints delivered to the LLM.                                                                    |
| Explainable form scores                      | A score of 74/100 is meaningless without breakdown. Showing "Range of Motion: 82, Core stability: 61, Symmetry: 79" gives users something to act on                                                       | LOW        | Schema design decision more than engineering lift. Define breakdown categories per exercise type.                                                                                                            |
| Offline workout execution                    | Users train in gyms with poor signal. Competitor apps that require connectivity mid-workout get abandoned. Downloading a workout for offline use is a clear differentiator vs cloud-dependent competitors | MEDIUM     | Local SQLite via Expo + sync on reconnect. Not v1 scope but plan the data model for it now.                                                                                                                  |

### Anti-Features (Commonly Requested, Often Problematic)

Features that seem good but create disproportionate cost or risk.

| Feature                                        | Why Requested                                                           | Why Problematic                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Alternative                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Social feed / sharing workouts                 | Users want community; sharing feels viral                               | Social content moderation, spam, feed ranking, and real-time infra are a separate product. Freeletics spent years on this. It dilutes focus from AI coaching, which is the actual differentiator                         | Add a simple "share this form score" deep-link card. Let iOS/Android native share sheets handle it. No in-app feed.                           |
| Nutrition / meal planning                      | Users associate fitness with diet; cross-sell opportunity feels obvious | Nutrition is a regulated domain with its own data complexity (food databases, calorie APIs, dietary restriction logic). It doubles the product surface for a calisthenics-first app                                      | Out of scope v1. If demanded, partner with an existing nutrition API (e.g., Nutritionix) rather than building from scratch.                   |
| Wearable integration (Apple Watch, Garmin)     | Users expect their fitness data connected                               | Heart rate and biometric sync adds a third SDK surface with platform-specific permission flows. It doesn't improve form analysis quality.                                                                                | Defer entirely. The AI form feedback loop does not require biometric data. Re-evaluate at v2 if users ask.                                    |
| Auto-detect exercise from video                | "The app should know what I'm doing" is a frequent user request         | Auto-detection accuracy is low (~60-70%) for bodyweight movements (pose estimation alone cannot distinguish push-up variants from dips easily). False detection breaks the analysis trust                                | Require the user to select the exercise before recording. This matches how Gymscore and ChAIron handle it. Clearly explain why in onboarding. |
| Full AI form analysis on 2500+ exercises       | Breadth signals completeness                                            | Deep, accurate, trustworthy analysis on 4-6 core moves is far more valuable than shallow analysis on hundreds. Each exercise needs a custom scoring rubric, cueing logic, and test data. Spreading thin destroys quality | Launch with push-ups, pull-ups, dips, squats. Make coverage depth and accuracy a quality signal, not exercise count.                          |
| Live video streaming / virtual trainer session | "Talk to an AI trainer live" sounds compelling                          | WebRTC + real-time AI inference on a server is extreme infrastructure complexity with high latency risk. The UX bar to be better than a Zoom call with a human trainer is very high                                      | Post-set analysis + real-time on-device inference (if resources allow) covers the same user need without server-streaming complexity.         |
| In-app chat between users                      | Community requests                                                      | Real-time messaging is a separate product with moderation, safety, and infrastructure requirements                                                                                                                       | Not in scope. No in-app social messaging.                                                                                                     |
| Nutrition / food logging                       | Frequently bundled in fitness apps                                      | Outside domain of calisthenics / AI form. Adds data complexity without advancing core value                                                                                                                              | Out of scope. Refer users to MyFitnessPal.                                                                                                    |

### Dependency Notes

- **User Profile required by AI Workout Generation:** The LLM prompt must include fitness level, goals, and available equipment. Without this context the output is generic and low quality.
- **Manual Workout Builder validates AI Workout Generation:** Users who build their own workouts develop intuition for what a good workout looks like. This makes them better evaluators of AI output, reducing the "AI gave me something weird" churn risk.
- **Post-set analysis precedes real-time cues:** Real-time is the same pose estimation pipeline running at inference time on live frames instead of a video file. You cannot de-risk real-time until you know the analysis produces trustworthy output on uploaded video first.
- **Progress Tracking requires both Session data and Form Scores:** If form analysis is not yet built, progress tracking falls back to session frequency only (useful but incomplete). Plan schema to accommodate both from the start.

## MVP Definition

### Launch With (v1) — This Milestone

- [ ] User profile (name, avatar, fitness level, goal) — required anchor for personalization claims
- [ ] Manual workout builder — saves named workouts with exercises, sets, reps, rest
- [ ] AI workout generation from goal description — differentiator; validates LLM integration before video pipeline
- [ ] Post-set AI form analysis — upload video, receive form score + breakdown + feedback text (push-ups, pull-ups, dips, squats)
- [ ] Progress tracking — session history list, per-exercise form score trend chart, overall form score trend
- [ ] Real-time form cues (live camera) — high-value differentiator; implement after post-set analysis is validated

### Add After Validation (v1.x)

- [ ] Offline workout download — add when users report connectivity problems mid-session (trigger: support requests or low session completion rate in poor-signal areas)
- [ ] Explainable form score breakdown UI improvements — add when initial scoring schema is validated by user feedback
- [ ] Push notification rules (e.g., "rest day reminder") — add after baseline session frequency data is available to inform timing

### Future Consideration (v2+)

- [ ] Additional exercise coverage beyond core 4 — add after AI quality on core moves is consistently rated useful by users
- [ ] Wearable integration — defer until users ask for it and AI form pipeline is mature
- [ ] Social sharing card — lightweight share, no feed; add when retention metrics show social as a growth lever

**Key competitive gap to exploit:** No single competitor combines LLM workout generation AND AI form analysis AND real-time cues in a calisthenics-focused package. Freeletics owns generation + community. Gymscore owns post-hoc analysis. ChAIron owns real-time. Cali-AI can own all three for the calisthenics vertical.
